The dataset used in this project is the Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset from Kaggle:

Due to GitHub file size limitations, only a small subset (10â€“20 images per class) is included for demonstration.
To train on the full dataset, please download it from the link above and place it in the dataset/chest_xray folder with the same structure.
